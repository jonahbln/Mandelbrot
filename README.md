* Name
  * Jonah Nidorf

  * NOTES FOR RUNNING THE PROGRAM:

  * the program runs on OpenGL 4.2 and runs in the command line with "python3 build.py && ./project"

  * the speed of zooming/moving/animating may differ slightly based on hardware

  * make sure when compiling that '-O2' optimizations are used (this has been added to the build.py, so it should work by default)
